# ETLWithPython

Working of the application:
Input file Data.txt is read through File Reader and data is extracted from it.
Output file WriteData.txt is then opened and each line is then capitalized and written in the Output file.
We pass the same WriteData.txt file for calculating the word summary,
With the help of dictionary each word is stored as key and with every iteration it's count is increased.
Once the dictionary is ready with all the words the data is then loaded into Summary.txt file showing the frequency of each word.
